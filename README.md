# Cook With Gas: The RPA Challenge

Welcome to **Cook With Gas**, an RPA (Robotic Process Automation) challenge project that automates the legendary [rpachallenge.com](https://rpachallenge.com/) using Python, Robocorp‚Äôs browser automation tools, and Playwright. This repo is hot, fast, and ready to serve up automation with maximum efficiency‚Äîno more ‚Äúworks on my machine‚Äù drama.

## üç≥ What does it do?

- Downloads an Excel file from rpachallenge.com.
- Reads the records with the help of RPA.Excel.Files.
- Uses Robocorp‚Äôs browser library (powered by Playwright) to fill out all challenge entries, lightning-fast.
- Takes a victory screenshot and saves results in the `output` folder.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

- [Robocorp Code extension for VS Code](https://robocorp.com/docs/developer-tools/visual-studio-code/extension-features)
- Or [RCC CLI](https://github.com/robocorp/rcc?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) for running from the command line

### 2. Run the Bot

Using VS Code:
```
# Open the repo and use the Robocorp side panel to run the task.
```

Using RCC:
```
rcc run
```

### 3. See Results

Check out `output/log.html` for a detailed run log and find your ‚Äúcongratulations‚Äù screenshot in the same folder!

## üßë‚Äçüíª Dependencies

Define everything in `conda.yaml` for robust, repeatable environments‚Äîno more dependency mess. Get the full power of [conda-forge](https://prefix.dev/channels/conda-forge) and [rpaframework](https://robocorp.com/docs/python/rpa-framework).

## üî• How it Works

- The main logic is in `tasks.py`, where the bot:
  - Downloads the challenge Excel file.
  - Reads the data.
  - Automates the form filling with Playwright.
  - Takes a screenshot upon success.

- Orchestrated by Prefect Flows in `main.py` for easy management.
